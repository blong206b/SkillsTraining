        <h1>OSINT for job candidates: Protect your online reputation</h1><br><br>
        <p>OSINT, or open-source intelligence, is the process of collecting and analyzing information from publicly available sources. Job candidates can use OSINT to check their online footprint and see what potential employers can find out about them.
            This is important because employers are increasingly using OSINT to screen job candidates.</p><br><br>

        <ol>
            <li>Employers may look into your criminal history, address, phone number, email address, education, work experience, skills, social media profiles, online resume, LinkedIn profile, credit report, driving record, and online activity.</li>
            <li>You can use OSINT to check your own footprint outside of Googling your name. There are a number of tools and suggestions available to help you do this.</li>
            <li>It is important to be aware of the background data that employers may be interested in so that you can take steps to protect your privacy and manage your online reputation.</li>
